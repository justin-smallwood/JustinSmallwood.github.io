				<p>The final group project of "MAE 322: Mechanical Design" is to design and manufacture a Search and Rescue Robot (SaRR). I was enrolled in this course in Fall 2024.
					The robot traversed a course that included going over a ramp, traveling through a chute, ascending a foot high wall, and delivering a medical kit into a basket.
					I was responsible for assisting in the coding and manufacturing of the SaRR.

				<p>The robot is 16" x 24" x 10" with five proximity sensors and two cadmium sulfide light sensors. Our design choices were based largely on goals for consistent driveability and mounting the wall obstacle.
					Two different types of wheels will be utilized: the front wheels will be omni-directional wheels and the back wheels will be traction wheels. 
					The motors will be connected to the wheels via a pulley and timing belt system. The frame of the robot is made out of 6061 aluminim for its high strength and relatively low weight.

				<p>One of the major design challenges of this course was mounting the wall. Our solution to this problem was to design a scissor lift that would grab onto a bar hanging directly over the wall,
					and have the robot pull itself up and drop onto the floor. It was a requirement of the course to ensure that the robot was durable, so there was little concern that it would break 
					when hitting the floor. Additionally, two rods were placed at the front of the robot to protect the medical kit container and make sure that the robot would land upright on the ground. The tilt mechanism 
					and scissor lift were controlled with two leadscrews. I assisted in the design, 3D printing of the supports of the tilting mechanism, and manufacturing of the rods at the front of the robot.

				<p> The SaRR autonomously traversed the course through the use of a TeensyÂ® USB Development Board (Teensy 4.1). In the code, I created a variable called ActCounter which split the code into
					five sections based on data collected by the light and proximity sensors. The logic behind the code is listed in the following flowchart:
