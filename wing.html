				<h1><b>Airplane Wing</b></h1>
			</header>
			<p>This project was a group assignment for "MAE 321: Engineering Design". The specification of the project were to design and manufacture an airplane wing that was 23.5 inches with a surface 
				area of 98 to 102 in<sup>2</sup> (per side) and could withstand a minimal load of 97 pounds on one end of wing. I was responsible for manufacturing the wing through the use of a lathe, milling machine, and CNC machine.

			</section>
			<p>The wing was manufactured with a hollow cross section that had an aluminum 7075 I-beam running parallel to the wing axis. The I-beam was manufactured on a 3-axis CNC mill.
				Bulkheads, secured with rivets, allowed for the connection of the I-beam to the wing surface (curved sheet metal) to enable the distribution of induced force throughout the wing.

			<p>Analysis of the I-beam was performed to ensure that the wing could withstand the load without breaking.
				Analysis of the I-beam also allowed my team to identify that trusses on the interior of the beam would maximize the load that the beam could handle while also reducing the overall weight.

			<p>The airplane wing exceeded the specifications of the project was able to wistand a load greater than 97 pounds.
				At 150 pounds, there was breakage in the I-beam which resulted in plastic deformation. The breaking point experienced the maximum load at the same point predicted by the Creo simulation.
